# KeePass

This is a fork of the official [KeePass](https://keepass.info/).

You can find KeePass source [here](https://github.com/dlech/KeePass2.x).

This fork was made to extend KeePass ability to work with plugins like [KeePassChallenge](https://github.com/pragacz/KeePassChallenge).

## Installation

Just overwrite the files in the KeePass directory with the files from the corresponding [release](https://github.com/pragacz/KeePass/releases).

## Branches

The default branch is `VS2022`. You should be able to clone this branch and build it
in Visual Studio 2022 with no changes.

The `official` branch contains exactly the official source code that is distributed on
SourceForge.
